Retain data lineage / metadata
In SQL Server, the MINUS operator, which is used in some other SQL dialects (such as Oracle), is not directly available. 
  Instead, you can use a combination of EXCEPT and UNION to compare tables for differences.

Performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) checks is crucial to ensure data integrity and accuracy throughout the data processing pipeline. 
  Various tools and frameworks are available for this purpose, each offering unique features to help identify and rectify errors. Here are some popular tools and methods to perform ETL checks:

  
1. Apache Airflow
Description: Apache Airflow is an open-source tool to programmatically author, schedule, and monitor workflows.
ETL Check Features: Custom sensors, operators, and task dependencies to implement data validation checks.
Use Case: Schedule and monitor ETL jobs with custom data validation steps.

8. Microsoft SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)
Description: SSIS is a platform for building enterprise-level data integration and transformation solutions.
ETL Check Features: Data flow transformations, data profiling tasks, and built-in data quality checks.
Use Case: ETL process automation with integrated data validation in SQL Server environments.
9. Pytest
Description: Pytest is a testing framework for Python.
ETL Check Features: Custom test cases for data validation in ETL scripts written in Python.
Use Case: Automated testing and validation for Python-based ETL processes.
10. Data Validation Library (Google Cloud)
Description: The Data Validation library is an open-source Python library for data validation.
ETL Check Features: Create and run data validation tests to compare data across different environments.
Use Case: Validate data consistency between source and destination in Google Cloud environments.
  
Key ETL Check Types
  
Schema Validation: Ensure that the structure of the data (columns, data types) is consistent between source and target.
  Mapping executed correctly? can calculate mapping result as a simulation then compare
  source minus except intersect target (source except target in sql server)

Data Type Checks: Verify that data types are correctly maintained during transformation.
Data Completeness: Ensure no data is missing or truncated during the ETL process.
  Check for NULL Values
  - count total row count
Data Accuracy: Validate that data is correctly transformed and calculations are accurate.
Data Consistency: Check that data remains consistent across different stages of the ETL pipeline.
Duplicate Detection: Identify and handle duplicate records.
Range Checks: Validate that data falls within expected ranges or sets of values.
  , boundary check max min value / string length
  
Custom Business Rules: Implement specific checks relevant to business logic or domain-specific requirements.
Conclusion
Choosing the right tool for ETL checks depends on your specific needs, the complexity of your ETL processes, and your existing technology stack. Tools like Great Expectations, dbt, and Talend offer robust data validation features that can be integrated into your ETL workflows to ensure data quality and integrity.

Google Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed service for stream and batch data processing that supports ETL processes. 
  It is part of the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and is built on the Apache Beam programming model. Here’s how you can leverage Dataflow for ETL tasks and ensure data quality:

Key Features of Dataflow for ETL
Unified Stream and Batch Processing: Dataflow can handle both real-time (stream) and batch data processing within the same framework.
Scalability: It can scale automatically to handle varying data volumes, ensuring efficient processing.
Flexibility with Apache Beam: Dataflow uses Apache Beam, allowing you to write pipelines in multiple languages (Java, Python, etc.) and then execute them on Dataflow.
Steps to Implement ETL with Dataflow
Extract:

Read data from various sources such as Cloud Storage, BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and other databases.
Example: Reading from Cloud Storage
python
Copy code
with beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) as p:
    lines = p | 'ReadFromGCS' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket_name/input_data.txt')
Transform:

Apply transformations to clean, enrich, or modify the data.
Example: Parsing and transforming data
python
Copy code
parsed_data = (
    lines
    | 'ParseCSV' >> beam.Map(lambda line: dict(zip(['field1', 'field2', 'field3'], line.split(','))))
    | 'FilterValidData' >> beam.Filter(lambda row: row['field1'] is not None)
)
Load:

Write the processed data to target destinations such as BigQuery, Cloud Storage, or other databases.
Example: Writing to BigQuery
python
Copy code
parsed_data | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
    'project_id:dataset_id.table_id',
    schema='field1:STRING, field2:STRING, field3:STRING',
    write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE
)
Ensuring Data Quality in Dataflow ETL
Schema Validation:

Define and enforce schemas for data to ensure consistency.
Use Beam’s Schema API to enforce schema.
python
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.io.gcp.bigquery import BigQuerySource

schema = 'field1:STRING, field2:STRING, field3:STRING'
table_spec = 'project:dataset.table'

parsed_data | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
    table_spec, schema=schema,
    write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE)
Data Validation:

Use Apache Beam’s assert_that transform for data validation in the pipeline.
python
Copy code
from apache_beam.testing.util import assert_that, equal_to

assert_that(parsed_data, equal_to(expected_data))
Custom Validation Steps:

Add custom transforms to perform specific validations.
python
Copy code
class ValidateData(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        if element['field2'] < 0:
            raise ValueError('field2 should be non-negative')
        yield element

valid_data = parsed_data | 'ValidateData' >> beam.ParDo(ValidateData())
Monitoring and Logging:

Use Dataflow’s monitoring tools to keep track of pipeline performance and errors.
Example: Enabling logging within transforms
python
Copy code
import logging

class LogErrors(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        try:
            # Processing logic
            yield element
        except Exception as e:
            logging.error(f"Error processing element {element}: {e}")

processed_data = parsed_data | 'LogErrors' >> beam.ParDo(LogErrors())
Automated Testing:

Create unit tests for your Apache Beam transforms to ensure they work as expected.
Example: Using the Beam testing framework
python
Copy code
from apache_beam.testing.test_pipeline import TestPipeline
from apache_beam.testing.util import assert_that, equal_to

def test_pipeline():
    with TestPipeline() as p:
        input_data = p | beam.Create([
            'value1,value2,value3',
            'value4,value5,value6'
        ])
        result = input_data | 'ParseCSV' >> beam.Map(lambda line: line.split(','))
        expected_output = [['value1', 'value2', 'value3'], ['value4', 'value5', 'value6']]
        assert_that(result, equal_to(expected_output))
Example ETL Pipeline with Dataflow
Here is a complete example of an ETL pipeline using Dataflow:

python
Copy code
import apache_beam as beam
from apache_beam.options.pipeline_options import PipelineOptions

class ParseCSV(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        import csv
        for row in csv.reader([element]):
            yield {
                'field1': row[0],
                'field2': int(row[1]),
                'field3': float(row[2])
            }

class FilterData(beam.DoFn):
    def process(self, element):
        if element['field2'] >= 0:
            yield element

pipeline_options = PipelineOptions()

with beam.Pipeline(options=pipeline_options) as p:
    (p
     | 'ReadFromGCS' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('gs://bucket_name/input_data.csv')
     | 'ParseCSV' >> beam.ParDo(ParseCSV())
     | 'FilterData' >> beam.ParDo(FilterData())
     | 'WriteToBigQuery' >> beam.io.WriteToBigQuery(
         'project_id:dataset_id.table_id',
         schema='field1:STRING, field2:INTEGER, field3:FLOAT',
         write_disposition=beam.io.BigQueryDisposition.WRITE_TRUNCATE
     ))
In this example, the ETL pipeline reads data from a CSV file in Google Cloud Storage, parses it, filters it, and writes it to BigQuery, ensuring data integrity through each step.

Conclusion
Google Cloud Dataflow, combined with Apache Beam, offers a robust framework for implementing ETL pipelines with powerful data validation and quality checks. By leveraging these tools, you can ensure that your ETL processes are efficient, scalable, and maintain high data quality standards.
